# Weather Vue

Weather app using Vue.js, Google Maps Geocoding, and Dark Sky.

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krestaino/weather-vue/master/static/images/og.jpg)

## Getting Started

``` bash
# clone repo and API submodule
git clone git@github.com:joshsisley/vue-weather.git --recursive

# to fetch submodule if already cloned without the `--recursive` flag
git submodule update --init
```

## API Backend

The API backend for this project is a REST API using Node and Express. It's included in this project as a submodule and located in `./api`. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/krestaino/weather-api). This backend API fetches geolocation data from Google and weather data from Dark Sky and returns it to the Weather Vue app.

Rename `./api/keys.js.example` to `./api/keys.js` and add your [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) and [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) keys.  

## Build Setup

Rename `./keys.js.example` to `./keys.js` and add your [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) keys. This API key is for the background map which uses the Google Maps JavaScript API. The `prod` key is exposed in your frontend code, so make sure you restrict the HTTP referrer to only allow requests from your production URL. This can be done in the Google API Console. The `dev` key is not included in production code, so it doesn't need the same restrictions.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 and API at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
